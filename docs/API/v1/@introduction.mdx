description: API Reference for top.gg
---

The v1 API follows RESTful principles: each exposed resource has a dedicated endpoint and supports the appropriate HTTP methods.

#### Base Url

```
https://top.gg/api/v1
```

## Authentication

To access the API, authorize requests with your Top.gg token. You can do this by creating a token from your project's **Integrations & API** settings.

Include it in the `Authorization` header:

```json:title=HTTP%20Headers
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer $TOPGG_TOKEN"
}
```

Legacy tokens without the Bearer prefix continue to work with v0 endpoints, but moving forward with v1, this is no longer allowed.

## Error Handling

All error responses follow the [`application/problem+json`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) specification.  

A typical error looks like this:

```ts
type ProblemDetails = {
  type: string,
  title: string,
  status: HTTPStatusCode,
  detail: string
}
```
